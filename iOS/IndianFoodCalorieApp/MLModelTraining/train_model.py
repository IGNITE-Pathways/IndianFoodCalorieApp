    To train the model:
    
    1. Install required packages:
       pip install coremltools tensorflow createml-community
    
    2. Prepare your dataset in the datasets/ directory
    
    3. Use CreateML or TensorFlow to train the model:
       - Input: 224x224 RGB images
       - Output: Indian food class predictions
       - Architecture: MobileNetV3 or EfficientNet (optimized for mobile)
    
    4. Convert to Core ML format:
       - Save as 'IndianFoodClassifier.mlmodel'
       - Include in iOS app bundle
    
    5. Test the model with sample images
